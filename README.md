# OOP_CONCEPTS
## Object and Classes
### Objects

Object is a unit in OOP and also a related existance of a class.Objects store attributes and behaviours of a class.For example Ali is an Object and the related existance of Human class.
### Attributes

Basically Attributes are properties which represents some changeable information,which helps to recognize about certain something.Attributes are variable of a class.The basic example is the attributes of a person.Names,Age,Color,Gender etc.Now these attributes are not just the properties/characteristics of human,but also each of them represent some information which helps to understand or recognize certain person.
### Behaviours

In general,the behaviours are actions that are performed by a moveable thing.And in programming,behaviours are the functions of a certain piece of code.And in OOP behaviours are related to real life scenarios.Like Walking,Eating,Sneezing etc.
### Classes

A class is a DataType,and it is UserDefined datatype.Classes hold attributes and behaviours.A class is also known as an entity.It is a blue print of the attributes and behaviours.It is a block which is used to hold infromation and perform functions.
### Inheritence

Inheritence is a technique,which is used to remove data repeating.Inheritance work on Parent and Child classes terms.Inheritence make us able to get all the data of the parent class which child class needs,and the child class can also have it's own data as well.For example Vehicle is a parent class.And cars,busses,trucks are the child classes of Vehicle.Now cars and busses can also be called a vehicle because both have the same properties of their parent vehivle.But a car can not be called a bus and vice versa,because both have properties which makes them different from each other.
### Methode Overriding

It is a polymorphisem technique.IT allows a person to achieve run time polymorphisem.In methode overriding,derived classes can a have same name functions even with same number and named parameters,as of parent class function.If base class function does not have any parameter,and derived or inherited class function whose name is same of parent class function, but this function have some parameters then it is not MethodeOverriding.The objects of the classes, points which function will be running.MethodeOverriding is an example of Late or Dynamic binding.
